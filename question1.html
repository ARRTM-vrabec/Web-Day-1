<h1>BUTTERFLY 11 (+PSYCHE)_w/pholo_ii</h1>
<ul></ul>
<br>[Verse 1]
<br>Butterfly eleven, trapped in a locket
<br>Pacify the present even if it's toxic
<br>Butterfly eleven, I'm so exhausted
<br>Satisfy my heaven even if it's toxic

<br>[Pre-Chorus 1]
<br>Didn't ask for this metamorphosis
<br>I'll spread my wings and I'll get away with it
<br>Can't pause for this metamorphosis
<br>I'm ignoring it
<br>And I'm breaking promises
<br>And I'm breaking promises
<br>And I'm breaking promises

<br>Butterfly eleven, trapped in a locket
<br>Butterfly eleven, I'm so еxhausted
<br>Didn't ask for this metamorphosis
<br>I'll spread my wings and I'll gеt away with this
<br>(And I'll get away with it)
<br>Butterfly eleven, trapped in a locket
<br>(Falling into my abyss, [?] like this)
<br>Butterfly eleven, I'm so exhausted
<br>(Every time I hear you move I [?])
<br>Didn't ask for this metamorphosis
<br>(Every time I make you move I am in a [?])
<br>I'll spread my wings and I'll get away with this
<br>(And I'll get away with it)

<br>(Verse 3]
<br>Wrapped up in my flutter
<br>Hid amongst the clutter
<br> wings in the gutter
<br>I didn't want to see me suffer
<br>If I want it, I'll go get it
<br>I'm forgetting, I regret it
<br>I go, go, go, ghost
<br>This isn't what I hoped
<br>Aphrodite
<br>Why do you spite me?
<br>I can't cope, cope, cope
<br>Your hands around my throat
<br>I am Psyche
<br>So reunite me
<br>I go bro-bro-broke
<br>This isn't what I hoped
